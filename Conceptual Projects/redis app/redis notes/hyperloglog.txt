# HYPERLOG datatype in redis
> Algorithm for approximately counting the number of unique elements
> Similar to a set, but doesn't store the elements

> There are only two commands in hyperloglog 
# PFADD command
PFADD key string/number
PFADD vegetables celery [ returns 1 ]
PFADD vegetables celery [ returns 0 ]


# PFCOUNT [ approx # of elements ]
PFCOUNT vegetables [ returns 1 because one items in vegetables ]

# when to use this datastructure ?
> We want each views to be unique per user in any views like post views, reels view , product views etc...
> can also implement using set but using this will have less memory efficient than using hyperloglog datastructure

When user views an items
PFADD views:5 username1 [ add username 1 in views of product 5 ]
> becuase hyperloglog doesnot store actual data , the memory is efficient than using set for this specific use case
> downside is this gives approximat value so there might be error in the counting.
